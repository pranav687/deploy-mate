# DeployMate â€“ Automated Deployment for React and Next.js Applications

**DeployMate** is an automated deployment pipeline for React and Next.js applications. It streamlines the deployment process by cloning code from GitHub and assigning subdomains for each deployment. DeployMate efficiently manages isolated environments for parallel deployments, significantly enhancing speed and efficiency, while incorporating real-time logging for improved data accessibility and monitoring.
